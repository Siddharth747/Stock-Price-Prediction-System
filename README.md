# Stock-Price-Prediction-System
As Stock price data is a form of time series data, it becomes very crucial to understand that not every model is functional and accurate over this kind of data. 
Hence I specifically chose a form of RNN- called LSTM, which in itself is a modified version of RNN. 

Stocks, also known as shares or equity, represent ownership in a publicly traded company. 
When one buys a stock, they are essentially purchasing a small piece of the company, and as a shareholder, and have a right to a portion of the company's profits.


Stock market prediction is the process of predicting future stock market movements using a variety of methodologies and models. Stock market forecasting is to assist investors, traders, and others to reach competent decisions on buying, selling, or maintaining a portfolio of stocks based on the probable future performance of the market or a specific stock.


Networks with long short-term memory (LSTM): A particular class of neural network called LSTMs is very effective at handling sequential data, like time series. They may be applied for both forecasting and anomaly detection and are able to capture long-term relationships in the data.

Time series forecasting may be done using the ensemble learning method known as gradient boosting machines (GBMs). To construct a powerful overall model, they combine several weak models (usually decision trees).


Due to the complexity and volatility of the financial markets, stock price prediction is a difficult task. Numerous variables, such as economic data, geopolitical developments, corporate performance, investor attitude, and many more, have an impact on stock prices. It is challenging to forecast future stock values with high accuracy due to the complexity and frequently unanticipated interactions that these factors might have. Also in forecasting the future of a stock it becomes imperative that whatever model is used can remember the previous proceedings of the stock market. 

In order to solve this issue, machine learning methods like LSTM networks have been created to simulate the correlations between historical stock price data and future stock price projections. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) of the LSTM type excel in handling sequential data, such as time series data.

The capacity of LSTM networks to simulate intricate connections in time series data is its main benefit. LSTM networks are able to capture complicated and non-linear relationships in the data, in contrast to classic machine learning approaches like linear regression or decision trees, which presume that the relationship between input and output variables is linear or can be modelled using simple functions.
